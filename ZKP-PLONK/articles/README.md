《理解 PLONK 系列》的原作者是来自 安比实验室（SECBIT Labs）的 [gy001](https://github.com/gy001)，[原文的仓库](https://github.com/sec-bit/learning-zkp/tree/master/plonk-intro-zh)。

本系列是在保留原作者的原文框架结构的基础上，对原文进行了进一步的解构和扩充。笔者也是从零到一开始学习 PlonK 的，笔者在学习完原文之前对相关理论和协议运行逻辑的理解为0。作为一个纯文科生，学习的过程中与理解文中涉及到的数学公式、协议逻辑开展了一番痛苦的纠缠。但正如 PlonK 一样，美酒越品越醇，当掌握了 PlonK 中的一些“套路”，对于很多协议的理解会更加深刻。

本文在原作者的授权下，以笔者完全个人的、纯小白的视角，对原作者的文章进行了解构和梳理，希望可以帮助到有需要的大家，也欢迎交流建议，帮助我更好地完善内容🙏。

## English 

The original author of the *"Understanding PLONK Series"* is [gy001](https://github.com/gy001) from SECBIT Labs, and the [repository of the original work](https://github.com/sec-bit/learning-zkp/tree/master/plonk-intro-zh) can be found here.

This series is based on the framework and structure of the original work, with further deconstruction and expansion. I started learning PLONK from scratch, and before studying the original material, my understanding of the related theories and protocol logic was essentially zero. As someone with an entirely liberal arts background, I had a tough time grappling with the mathematical formulas and protocol logic involved in the text. However, much like PLONK itself, it gets better the more you explore it—like fine wine. Once you grasp some of the "patterns" in PLONK, your understanding of many other protocols deepens significantly.

With permission from the original author, this article reconstructs and organizes the content from my own perspective as a complete beginner. I hope it can help those who need it, and I welcome suggestions and feedback to improve the content 🙏.
